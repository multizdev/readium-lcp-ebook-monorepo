## Discussion

### Notes

Jiminy:
Re Monday’s call, here’s a list of what was done in shared-models on the JBKS repo (https://github.com/Jellybooks/jbks-shared-web/pull/1)

* Added what Mickaël reported as missing in interfaces during his review;
made things more consistent (naming, etc.);
* Improved extensibility (subcollections, properties, etc.);
* Added packaged formats + MediaTypes so that people can use these if they wish to handle ZIP-like inputs;
* Added missing methods in some classes (e.g. URITemplate in Link);
* Added Navigator interfaces based on the Public API doc.

I’ve been constantly checking these in our own implementation to make sure it’s OK – still must unit test some added stuff that was not a priority though – but I’m happy to report I didn’t encounter any significant issue so far, even with FXL and audiobooks (manifest), and perf seems even slightly better (I’m expecting it to be even better once I fully migrate some older manifest logic to Links).

Jiminy: expecting another review of the shared model.
Aferdita: ready to take the shared model into R2D2BC and give feedback from that.
Jiminy: it can used with any UI. 
Juan: I will use it in one of our projects. Will move relevant existing unit tests (Swift) to TS. 
Aferdita: this is our chance to have a perfect shared model, for all projects.
Jiminy: we have a streamer, same root as Daniel's streamer

All: the streamer is the union of a parser (e.g. EPUB) and a fetcher. But the WePub parser is in the shared model. In Readium Web we don't need a streamer, we need
* a Readium Manifest parser and a W3C Manifest parser
* a way to inject js (e.g. MathML) and css (readium-css)

About injecting, there are old documents available:
* https://readium.org/architecture/other/injection.html
* https://github.com/readium/architecture/blob/master/other/apis/CSS-JS%20Injection%20API.md

Laurent: we should finalize this so that it can be implemented in Readium Web (then in Mobile).
Aferdita: injectables can also be used for themes.
Aferdita: the next step is the navigator. 
Jiminy: I'm experimenting with the code from the Swift navigator, with threads for FXL 2-page spread and reflow support also. Has to be ported to TS from Swift. 
Aferdita: 2-page spread and media overlay with JS executed in one spread vs another spread can be an issue.
Kotlin is using webviews, like Readium Desktop. Swift is using iframes, like Readium Web. It's quite easier to implement media overlay using webviews than iframes. 
Laurent: But this does not stop us to deal with reflow. 
Mickaël: we should still model the work with a list of spreads containing pages, so that extending to 2-page spread is easy later. 

All: the name of the Readium Web repo on the Readium Github will be `r2-web`
Jiminy: I'll push a reflow navigator as a start. 
Other people will contribute from there.
