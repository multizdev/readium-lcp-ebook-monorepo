## Goals

- Share our thoughts, hear everyone out.
- Figure out what we can do.

## Discussion

MM: Proposals

JP: Readium Web
Readium shared repo

JC: Also made TS models, will post them.

QG: Not working on this right now.


### Why

- Why are we doing this?

- What are our reasons?

JC: wants web usable shared models.
has a project on current projects, but its dead now.

JC: Has a need:
- Take a manifest in JSON text.
- Usable model. Normalized version.
- Input fields could be arrays, bare strings, localized or not, etc.
- Too much complexity with logic that use model.
- Typings would be amazing.
- Convenience and helpers
- JP: Consistency across platforms
- MM: Reference, or a guide

JP: it's logical to contribute this work. need for web apps too.
would like to see contributions for feedback.

### What

- What do we want to do?

JC: Easy wins:
- TS models

MM: Publication Helpers and Services

MM: Manifest: de/serialization of JSON happens here. EPUB parsing

JC: Normalization proposal?
- Generate most complex structure
- Common denominators

MM: Unit tests. JSON Input -> Shared models
- Shared repo for unit tests
- Source EPUB -> JSON -> SM
- Used as a Git subtree
- Source data, cases, not exactly tests themselves in here.
- To make sure we test the same thing

JC: Unit Test example

- MM: https://github.com/readium/r2-shared-kotlin/blob/develop/r2-shared/src/test/java/org/readium/r2/shared/publication/LinkTest.kt

Prior art:
- https://github.com/readium/architecture/issues/84
- https://github.com/readium/readium-test-files


### Who

- Who could do what?

JP: TS models

MM & QG: Proposals

JC: Normalization proposal. TS models help

### When

Any timelines?

JP: EDRLab work (reflowable: mid May, FXL: September)

JC: 10% to 20% of time, ideally.

### How

- How are we doing this?

JC: Would a TS repo with code be sufficient?

MM: Cohesive API.


## Action Items

- Review proposals, to talk next week about them.
- Readium PR will be made.
