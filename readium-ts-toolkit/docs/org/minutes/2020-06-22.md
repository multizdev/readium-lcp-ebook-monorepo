## Discussion

### Notes

JP: Thank you for the review Mickael.

Let's go over the questions.

> Here are some points worth mentioning during our next call, but feel free to discuss beforehand:
> 
> * [Should the types be normalized?](https://github.com/Jellybooks/jbks-shared-web/pull/1#discussion_r442304815) For example, having a fullâ€“fledged `Contributor` object everywhere instead of a union type such as `type Contributor = string | IContributor | Array<string | IContributor>`.
> 

This has been simplified.

> * [Usage of interfaces to construct objects (e.g. `LinkLike`)](https://github.com/Jellybooks/jbks-shared-web/pull/1#discussion_r442317382)
> 

Why an interface?

-> [They are used to fix this issue](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/45507428/typescript-create-class-via-constructor-passing-in-named-parameters)

Mixed bag of input params: Let's rename the interface or find another solution.

One question about the specific use here with the constructor.

For the other shared models there's an interface and an implementation.

> * Regarding `Locator`:
>   

`Locator` as interface? For custom implementations, yes.

>   * [Refactoring the HTML extensions (e.g. `cssSelector`) in an extension](https://github.com/Jellybooks/jbks-shared-web/pull/1#discussion_r442337983)
>   
HTML extensions will most likely be used more in this web toolkit. Therefore first class properties or other ways to include it as close to that would be preferred. 

HG:
Adopting these as first class moves away from the Locators spec.
domRange is undercooked in the spec and is not ready for first class adoption.

Defer until later discussions.

For other cases of extensibility:
Add `otherLocations` map.

>   * [Making `locations` and `text` non-nullable](https://github.com/Jellybooks/jbks-shared-web/pull/1#discussion_r442338521)
>   
For convenience when using. If the data is null, then use empty object/string.

> * [Using `Date` objects instead of `string` for `published` and `modified`](https://github.com/Jellybooks/jbks-shared-web/pull/1/files#r442339228)
> 

> * Broader discussion about the `Manifest`:
>   
>   * [Should we remove `getManifest()` and `Store` from shared?](https://github.com/Jellybooks/jbks-shared-web/pull/1#discussion_r442351318)
>   

> * [Should an enum be used for `contains`?](https://github.com/Jellybooks/jbks-shared-web/pull/1#discussion_r442361696)

MM: Unit testing.
