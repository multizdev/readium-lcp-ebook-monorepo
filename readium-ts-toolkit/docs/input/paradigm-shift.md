# Paradigm Shift

Most applications fit this profile:

- Monolithic, developed for a specific purpose
- Tightly coupled codebase
- Lack of separation of concerns
- Significant understanding req. due to massive interdependencies
- Sparse documentation, fails to explain everything
- Re-use of code is challenging
- Unable to work on components independently
- Lack of overall abstraction
- Big list of features, very few done right
- Constantly changing product vision

Why?

- Lack of resources, management, direction
- Rush to release a product
- Proprietary and business concerns
- Limited tech interoperability
- Immature ecosystem
- Separated teams in separate silos
- No general overarching project to get behind
- Missing common ground for collaboration

The fix:
(talk about the new approach)

This project should help achieve this instead:

- Modular, developed for general use-cases
- Loosely coupled blocks of code
- Distributed, clarified, separations of concerns
- Required knowledged and experience can be scoped
- Able to focus on specific modules
- Modular documentation, easier to explain given boundaries
- Code can become inherently re-usable
- Components can be developed independently 
- Handful of solid, quality features
-
